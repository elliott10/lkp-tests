## aim7&aim9

usable: no

tag: cpu; io; function call; suite;

introduction: 

    AIM7 is a program written in C that forks many processes called tasks, each of which concurrently runs in random order a set of subtests called jobs.
    the AIM Independent Resource Benchmark exercises and times each component of a UNIX computer system, independently. The benchmark uses 58 subtests to generate absolute processing rates, in operations per second, for subsystems, I/O transfers, function calls, and UNIX system calls. GPL'd and can be published under the "non-audited" clause.

## blogbench

usable: hold

tag: io;

introdution: 

    Blogbench is a portable filesystem benchmark that tries to reproduce the load of a real-world busy file server.
    It stresses the filesystem with multiple threads performing random reads, writes and rewrites in order to get a realistic idea of the scalability and the concurrency a system can handle.

## ebizzy

usable: yes

tag: cpu; memory;

introduction:

    ebizzy is designed to generate a workload resembling common web application server workloads.  It is highly threaded, has a large in-memory working set with low locality, and allocates and deallocates memory frequently.  When running most efficiently, it will max out the CPU. The records per second rate should be as high as possible, and the system time as low as possible.

## kvm-unit-tests

usable: no

tag: boot; kvm;

introduction:

    kvm-unit-tests is a project as old as KVM. As its name suggests, it's purpose is to provide unit tests for KVM. The unit tests are tiny guest operating systems that generally execute only tens of lines of C and assembler test code in order to obtain its PASS/FAIL result. Unit tests provide KVM and virt hardware functional testing by targeting the features through minimal implementations of their use per the hardware specification. The simplicity of unit tests make them easy to verify they are correct, easy to maintain, and easy to use in timing measurements. Unit tests are also often used for quick and dirty bug reproducers. The reproducers may then be kept as regression tests. It's strongly encouraged that patches implementing new KVM features are submitted with accompanying unit tests.
